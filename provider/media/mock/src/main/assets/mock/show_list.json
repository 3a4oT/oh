We recommended trying out the 60 fps version and that you switch to the 30 fps version if your hardware has issues decoding the video.\n\nWhen viewing the video you should pick a resolution close to the native resolution of your screen or projector, then view the movie at \"1-to-1\" or \"100% scale\" - avoid scaling the video up or down.",
